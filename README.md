# Clusters-size
Tkinter GUI to estimate the gas clusters size when expanding into the vacuum after passing through a nozzle

A Gas cluster is a small particle that can contain 100 to 10 000 atoms bound together by Van Der Waals forces. Neutral clusters are produced in a supersonic expansion where a high pressure of gas is forced through a nozzle. The gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion and the clusters are formed upon cooling.
The interaction of laser pulses with clusters is an active area of research. Moreover cluster beams began to be extensively used for secondary-ion mass spectrometry.

The gas properties, source conditions, nozzle geometry affect the properties of the jet and thus the cluster formation. There is no quantative theory to decribe the cluster formation many experimental methods have been developed to estimate the cluster size.
